# Hybrid Clusterer - Trace Clustering for Process Mining
This repository contains the source code of the Hybrid Feature Set Clustering approach in our paper "Finding Structure in the Unstructured: Hybrid Feature Set Clustering for Process Discovery". You can run the code within the ProM Framework.

Note!: Please note that the version in this repository uses the Flexible Heuristics Miner of ProM that may produce malformed models. This may lead to unreliable and broken fitness values.
